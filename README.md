# slp-organizer-v2
## Description
Takes a directory containing .slp replay files as input and parses all the replay files to extract and consolidate metadata.

Updated version of [slp-organizer](https://github.com/itsonlyMiRE/slp-organizer) that stores data in a Python dictionary rather than reorganizing files.

## Setup
The program is written in Python3. The only third-party dependency can be installed with ``pip install peppi-py``.

## Usage
Run the program, and follow the instructions it prints.

## Notes
Might only be compatible with Linux as of right now, have not tested Windows.
